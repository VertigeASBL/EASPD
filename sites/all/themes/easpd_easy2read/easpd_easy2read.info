; This section lists the regions defined in the page.tpl.php. The name in 
; brackets is the machine name of the region. The text after the equals sign is
; a descriptive text used on the admin/structure/blocks page.
;
; In the page.tpl.php, the contents of the region are output with a
; $page['MACHINE-NAME'] variable. For example, with this line in the .info
; file:
;   regions[header] = Header
; You'll use this variable in page.tpl.php:
;   <?php print render($page['header']); ?>

regions[header]          = Header
regions[navigation]      = Navigation
regions[help]            = Help
regions[highlighted]     = Highlighted
regions[content]         = Content
; regions[sidebar_first]   = Sidebar Top
; regions[sidebar_second]  = Sidebar Bottom
regions[footer_first]    = Footer first
regions[footer_middle]   = Footer middle
regions[footer_last]     = Footer last

; The page_top and page_bottom regions are hidden, which means they will not
; show up on the blocks administration page. But they are required in order for
; the html.tpl.php to work properly, so do not delete them.

regions[page_top]       = Page top
regions[page_bottom]    = Page bottom
